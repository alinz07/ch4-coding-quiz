<br/>

## **Purpose**
Build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

<br/>

## **Challenge Criteria**
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz</br>

* WHEN I click the start button
 </br>
 THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

* WHEN I answer a question</br>
THEN I am presented with another question

* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly</br>
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0</br>
THEN the game is over

* WHEN the game is over</br>
THEN I can save my initials and score

<br/>

## **How and Why**
I had to split this up into many different functions because a lot of code was repeated. I used javascript, instead of jquery, to dynamically create and manipulate the html because this module focused on javascript methods.
<br/>
<br/>

## **Things I learned**
* I learned that jquery could've made this code a lot shorter, but wanted to use only the lessons we learned in this module.

* I practiced dynamically creating html elements, using event listeneres and explored accessing object properties.
<br/>
<br/>

## **What makes this project stand out?**
I most proud of the javascript function comments and order
